This repo generates a CV file for LaTeX that can be modified & tailored using typescript. Currently the features are limited & mainly skill tailoring, but eventually more complex things like gradient shading will be integrated. 'yarn watch' will run a daemon that builds the LaTeX file on save, then in combination with VSCode's LaTeX plugin, everything should compile.

TODO:
// TODO gradient colors
// % TODO IPA pronounciation
// % TODO highlight when a tech is mentioned
integrate w interactable frontend
Dockerize formally w latex dependencies
